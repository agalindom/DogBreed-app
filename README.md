# Overview

The repo contains the jupyter notebook for a dog-breed image classification app, using deep learning techniques.

# Libraries

- Pytorch
- Opencv
- Numpy
- Pillow
- Matplotlib

# Description

The notebook is divided in different parts, where each represents an essential part in order for the detector algorithm to work whuch are:

* Defining app functions
* Preprocessing
* Defining the arquitecture
* Training and testing the model
* App algorithm

# Usage

To test the algorithm go to the last section of the notebook and load the picture you want to detect
